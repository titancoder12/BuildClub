# Build Club

Build Club is a student‑led initiative focused on teaching students how to **build technology from the ground up**. The emphasis is not just on coding, but on understanding how real systems work — from web applications to modern AI‑assisted development.

The goal of Build Club is for students to leave with the confidence and ability to **build real, professional‑looking projects**, and to understand how AI can be used responsibly and effectively in modern development workflows.

## What Build Club Teaches

Build Club focuses on:
- Understanding how web applications work
- Learning by building, not following tutorials
- Developing problem‑solving and systems thinking
- Using AI as a **tool to build**, not a shortcut to skip understanding

Students first build projects manually to understand fundamentals, then learn how AI can dramatically accelerate development once those fundamentals are in place.

## Course 1: Build a Web Application

The first Build Club course introduces students to building a complete web application from scratch.

Students learn:
- How the web works
- HTML and CSS for structure and design
- Python and Flask for backend development
- SQLite for data storage
- How AI can be used to build a full web application from the ground up

The course concludes with a live demonstration showing how weeks of manual work can be recreated in minutes using AI — reinforcing the importance of understanding fundamentals in the AI era.
