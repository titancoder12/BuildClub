# Build Club

Build Club is a student‑led initiative focused on teaching students how to **build technology from the ground up**. The emphasis is not just on coding, but on understanding how real systems work — from software and web applications to hands‑on hardware projects involving micro‑controllers, processors, and 3D printing.

The goal of Build Club is for students to leave with the confidence and ability to **build real, professional‑looking projects**, and to understand how AI can be used responsibly and effectively in modern development workflows.

## What Build Club Teaches

Build Club focuses on:

* Learning how technology works by building it
* Learning by doing, not by following step-by-step tutorials
* Developing problem-solving and systems thinking
* Understanding how different components fit together to form complete systems
* Designing and fabricating physical components using **3D printing**

Students build projects from the ground up, gaining hands-on experience and confidence through experimentation, iteration, and guided support. This includes not only writing software, but also building and programming physical hardware using micro‑controllers and processors, as well as designing and fabricating parts with 3D printing.

## Course 1: Build a Web Application

The first Build Club course introduces students to building a complete web application from scratch.

Students learn:

* How the web works
* HTML and CSS for structure and design
* Python and Flask for backend development
* SQLite for data storage
* How AI can be used to build a full web application from the ground up

The course concludes with a live demonstration showing how weeks of manual work can be recreated in minutes using AI — reinforcing the importance of understanding fundamentals in the AI era.
