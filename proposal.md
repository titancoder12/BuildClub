## Program Overview

Build Club is a student-led technology club that teaches students how to **build technology from the ground up**. The program emphasizes understanding *how things work* before relying on automation tools such as artificial intelligence.

Unlike many coding clubs that focus on tutorials or prebuilt platforms, Build Club prioritizes **hands-on construction, problem-solving, and systems thinking**. Students create real projects step by step, developing a strong foundation in both software and hardware.

## Learning Philosophy

Build Club follows a three-stage learning approach:

1. **Build by Hand**  
   Students manually build projects to understand core concepts and cause-and-effect relationships.

2. **Understand Systems**  
   Students learn how software, hardware, and logic interact as complete systems.

3. **Accelerate with AI**  
   Once fundamentals are understood, students are introduced to AI tools as productivity aids—not as replacements for learning or thinking.

## Core Learning Areas

### 1. Web Development Foundations
Students build a simple web application entirely from scratch:
- HTML (structure)
- CSS (styling)
- JavaScript (interactivity)
- Backend fundamentals (server logic)
- Database basics (saving and retrieving data)

### 2. Game Development & Algorithms
Using Python and PyGame, students learn algorithmic thinking through interactive games:
- Game loops
- Collision detection
- State machines
- Grid-based logic
- Introductory pathfinding algorithms

### 3. Hardware & Physical Computing
Students are introduced to electronics and microcontrollers:
- Programming microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino)
- Sensors and inputs
- LEDs, motors, and actuators
- Connecting software to physical devices

### 4. Integrated Projects
Advanced students may work on integrated systems such as:
- Web dashboards controlling hardware
- Games using physical controllers
- Sensor data displayed on web interfaces
